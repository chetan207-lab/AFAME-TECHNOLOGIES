# Titanic Survival Prediction

Titanic Survivor Prediction Project Documentation

Company Name : Afame Technology

1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains details about the passengers, such as age, gender, class, and more. The main objective is to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.

2. Data Analysis
The dataset was first explored to understand the distribution of data and check for missing values. Common steps in this process include checking the summary statistics of the dataset, visualizing key attributes, and handling missing values.

3. Model Building and Training
Several machine learning algorithms were considered for this classification task. The models explored include:
• Logistic Regression
•	Decision Tree Classifier
•	Random Forest Classifier
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and each model was trained on the training set before being evaluated on the test set.

4. Evaluation and Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on these metrics, the best-performing model was selected and fine-tuned to improve its predictions. Additionally, feature importance was analyzed to understand which factors contributed the most to the model's decision-making.
